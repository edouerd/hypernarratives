[[Dream a dream]]

<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Dream a dream" tags="" position="175,25">I had a dream that mostly seemed like news, as though I was watching a news channel, or absorbing it directly into my mind via some neuro-interface. I had the distinct feeling I was witnessing actual reality, but I was removed from it completely.

The tone of the viewing was generally very neutral, with little in the way of any overt political leaning. Near the end of the dream, scenes of a white house deconstructed (in the midst of construction) flashed in the show as if i was watching from a helicopter.

A few pundits attempted to decode the meaning of the deconstructed white house, but didnâ€™t reach a conclusion. Apparently a part of the house had collapsed in the middle of a storm due to the weight of the tarp (it had been accumulating rain water I think)

A duo (a male outdoorsman and female host/outdoorswoman) took turn narrating the scenes, while fishing, [[describing]] the natural wildlife. The dream ended with the host commenting on how seriously fly fishermen took their work.</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="describing" tags="" position="175,175">A dreamier scene ... I might be in a lecture hall, or in a small room, or in skype chat, it&#39;s impossible to tell.

A voice fades in and out, it&#39;s trying to teach me a concept but I can&#39;t pay attention. I ebb between waking and deep sleep, stuck in that liminal space.</tw-passagedata>
